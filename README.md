An Immersive Lableing Method for Large Point Clouds.

Setup: Our method is implemented in C++ with OpenGL and OpenVR. Our test system was equipped with an Intel Core i7-9700F with 8Ã—3.0GHz, 16 GB RAM and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 with 8GB VRAM. Current button design is for HTC Vive Pro.

Build Instructions:

Using the Integrated Build System (Windows only). Currently, the Immersive Labeling works best on Windows. A Visual Studio project for building can be generated via the dedicated build system of the CGV Framework via: https://github.com/sgumhold/cgv/tree/develop-rgbd.
